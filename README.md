# Empirical-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-yield-curves.
Principal Component Analysis(PCA), Nelson-Siegel(NS) model, and Gaussian Regression Process(GPR) are used to fit and forecast the European yield curve with different maturities.

Modeling and forecasting interest
rate term structures is an important topic in economic study. We use statistical or parametric models
such as the Nelson-Siegel model, principal component analysis, and Gaussian process regression to model
yield curve data. For the analysis, we use European yields of 11 different maturities for 3-month, 6-month,
9-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year. We fit the yield curve to
predict future yields of different maturities and compare the forecasting results obtained from three models
